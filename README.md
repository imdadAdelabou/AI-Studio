## Architectures
First, we use Riverpod for the state management. Riverpod provides a better way to register providers into the widget tree and access them easily. It also provides an optimizable way to change a view state according to the result of an asynchronous API request. 

Our project files are separated into different directories. Each directory has a specific purpose. 
The models directory contains our data model.
The repository directory contains a set of functions to interact with our backend server and other external services. Each repository is registered inside the provider to easily access it globally.
The screens directory contains all the UI.
The widgets directory contains all the shared components.
The utils directory contains some reusable functions and constants.
The viewModels directory is like a controller, it connects the UI interface to the repository.
Basically, each feature has a UI screen, a serviceModel, and a repository associated with it. All connected using the power of provider.


## Management
We use github project to manage the project and here I will explain the meaning of S, XS, L and XL. It represent the complexity of a task and how many days it will take to accomplish this task.
- XS -> the task will take 01 day to finish
- S -> the task will take 02 days to finish
- L -> the task will take 03 days to finish
- XL -> the task will take more than 03 days to finish
